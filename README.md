[![Download Latest Release](https://img.shields.io/badge/Download_Latest_Release_%E2%86%93-1f425f?style=for-the-badge)](https://github.com/aapopei/Virtual-Museum-of-Geology/releases/latest)

**Geology Virtual Museum** is a high-fidelity, first-person virtual tour of the “Grigore Cobălcescu” Museum of Geology at the “Alexandru Ioan Cuza” University of Iaşi, Romania. Developed in the Unity engine, it uses a complete 3D Gaussian Splatting (3DGS) scene to create an immersive and realistic digital twin of the museum space.

This project was developed as part of the scientific article:

## 🎯 Project Goals

* To create a high-fidelity, true-to-life digital twin of a significant geoheritage site.
* To showcase the power of 3D Gaussian Splatting for creating large-scale, instantaneously loading virtual environments.
* To provide an accessible, immersive, and educational tool for virtual geotourism and geoeducation.
* To serve as a practical case study for the application of advanced 3D technologies in geosciences.
